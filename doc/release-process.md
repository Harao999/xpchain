Release Process
====================

Before every release candidate:

* Update translations, see [translation_process.md](https://github.com/xpc-wg/xpchain/blob/master/doc/translation_process.md#synchronising-translations).
* Update manpages, see [gen-manpages.sh](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/devtools/README.md#gen-manpagessh).

Before every minor and major release:

* Update [bips.md](bips.md) to account for changes since the last release.
* Update version in `configure.ac` (don't forget to set `CLIENT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE` to `true`)
* Write release notes (see below)
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` nMinimumChainWork with information from the getblockchaininfo rpc.
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` defaultAssumeValid with information from the getblockhash rpc.
  - The selected value must not be orphaned so it may be useful to set the value two blocks back from the tip.
  - Testnet should be set some tens of thousands back from the tip due to reorgs there.
  - This update should be reviewed with a reindex-chainstate with assumevalid=0 to catch any defect
     that causes rejection of blocks in the past history.

Before every major release:

* Update hardcoded [seeds](/contrib/seeds/README.md), see [this pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7415) for an example.
* Update [`BLOCK_CHAIN_SIZE`](/src/qt/intro.cpp) to the current size plus some overhead.
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` chainTxData with statistics about the transaction count and rate. Use the output of the RPC `getchaintxstats`, see
  [this pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12270) for an example. Reviewers can verify the results by running `getchaintxstats <window_block_count> <window_last_block_hash>` with the `window_block_count` and `window_last_block_hash` from your output.

Finally:
* Announce the release:
  - Update xpchain.io
  - Official announcements in Discord, Twitter, etc.
  - Archive release notes for the new version to `doc/release-notes/` (branch `master` and branch of the release)
  - Create a [new GitHub release](https://github.com/xpc-wg/xpchain/releases/new) with a link to the archived release notes.
  - Celebrate
